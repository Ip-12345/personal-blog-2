			<!-- About -->
			<article id="about">
				<h2 class="major">About</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2014 when I was 10. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS.
					My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, Pokemon go, and Tom and Jerry. It had a
					mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo
					button really did.<br /><br />

					At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for
					the first time.<br /><br />
					At 8, my parents bought me a Nexus 7 tablet which turned me into a gadget addict.<br /><br />
					When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering
					the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot
					of patience. I was unstoppable.<br /><br />
					At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that
					I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have contributed to
					two more.<br /><br />
					At 18, I took my first ALL India exam via which I secured a seat in NIT-P university .<br /><br />
					At 20, I have been typing all above stuff on the website that you are reading now.<br /><br />
					Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet. By the way, check out
					my <a href="#work">awesome work</a>.</p><br />
				<p>I LIKE<br />
					E-sports, Skiing, Travelling, Space, Summer, Colored pencils (Faber-Castell Polychromos),
					Photography
					Good design<br /><br />

					Travel / Geography<br />
					I am originally from Hyderabad, Telangana. I have since lived in Hyderabad and Patna.<br />
					I've been to all the southern states of India, many of which I would like to revisit.<br />
					In 2016, I visited Dubai, UAE...loved the GLOBAL VILLAGE and FERRARI WORLD.<br />
					In 2017, I visited Zambia, South Africa.<br /><br />

					FUN FACTS<br />
					I have a list of thousands of ideas, like creating matching bow ties for cats and humans.<br />
					I almost always have a sketchbook with me and a 01 Sakura Pigma Micron Pen.<br />
					I can't locate every country on a map.<br />
					I break about 30 traffic laws on a skateboard or bicycle every single day.<br />
					I stack-rank coffee shops, restaurants, and every dog I see here.<br /><br />

					I dream of...<br />
					Inspiring and feeling inspired.<br />
					Enabling a brighter future for everyone, regardless of political or socioeconomic status.<br />
					Treating every individual with genuine kindness and respect.<br />
					Staying curious.<br />
					Continually improving.<br /></p>
